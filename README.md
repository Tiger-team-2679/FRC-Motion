We can exploit the basic functionality of gradle by using the following commands:
* In order to build the code, we will use the build command
    ```

    ```
* In order to adjust the code to a specific ide or editor, we will to following commands:
    ```
    # to adjust the code to IntelliJ, we will use this command:
    $ ./gradlew idea

    $ ./gradlew  eclipse
    ```
